### Contribution

Want to contribute to ha-bambulab? Great! We have a few small asks though!

- Please create your patch PRs against the `main` branch.
- Please name your commits accordingly, and add some context as to what you have added.

NOTE - we did previously use a separate `develop` branch for staging initial checkins. This is being retired.

If you feel this integration was valuable and want to support it in other ways, you can [buy me a coffee](https://Ko-fi.com/adriangarside).
