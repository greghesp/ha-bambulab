| Total Usage Hours | \* See Note                                        |

<Info>
\* This is a running estimate that will be imprecise. Starting hours can be read of the printer screen and provided during initial printer setup or updated later via the configuration flow. And the integration must be running when a print completes to update the value. For non-X1 printers, if the integration is restarted mid-print and Bambu cloud connection isn't setup, the usage hours will not be added as print start time won't be known. It's expected that you'll need to adjust this value occasionally to fix drift from the value the printer itself calculates.
