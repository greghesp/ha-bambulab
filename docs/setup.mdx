For configuration, you'll ideally use your Bambu Credentials for the simplest setup and the most features as some sensors are supported by data from your Bambu cloud account print history.
You can also, optionally, provide the printer's local IP address to enable the more efficient and reliable direct to printer connection for the printer sensor data and to enable the P1/A1 chamber image support.

However, the Bambu cloud connection doesn't support 2FA and passwordless social media accounts at this time. And it obviously does not support printers explicitly set to Lan Only Mode.

### Configuring a Printer

1. Navigate to your Home Assistant's 'Settings' page (available in the sidebar).
2. Open 'Devices & Services' (second item in the list).
3. Click the 'Add Integration' button (typically in the bottom right).
4. In the pop up search for 'Bambu Lab' and select.
6. Follow the steps as prompted in the wizard.

### LAN Mode Setup

If you fall into any of these categories, select the Lan Mode Configuration connection option. You will need to manually provide:

- Printer Serial Number - can be found in the printer settings or in Bambu Studio.
- Local printer IP address - can be found in the printer network settings (LAN).
- Access Code - can be found in the Printer settings.

> Camera feeds for H2D / H2S - you must enable the "LAN Only Liveview" option in the LAN mode settings. It is not necessary to enable LAN mode generally to enable the "LAN Only Liveview" option. This simply enables the RTSP stream to be available locally. The camera feed will also continue to work via Bambu Studio / Bamby Handy remotely.

#### Advanced options

Advanced options should only be used for non-standard setup.

- Disable SSL verification - disabled certificate verification for MQTT, FTP and chamber camera connections to printer (unsafe).

### Setup using Bambu Cloud w/ OAuth

If you signed up using any OAuth method, you need to set a password for your Bambu Cloud account:

- Login to the Bambu mobile app using OAuth.
- Tap the person icon at the bottom right.
- Tap Account Security > Change Password.

This will allow you to set a password. Now you can login to the HA integration using your Bambu username and password
instead of OAuth.
