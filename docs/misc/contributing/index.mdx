## Adding Cards

<Warning>Please do not edit the `example-card`</Warning>

To develop a new card, copy the `example-card` folder and rename the folder, files to match, and the variables within `const.ts`

To include your card into the integration, open `ha-bambulab-cards.ts` and import your card:

```js
import "./cards/my-new-card/my-new-card";
```

Add your card to `custom_components/bambu_lab/const.py`, into the `BAMBU_LAB_CARDS` array. If you modify your card, ensure you update the version here
