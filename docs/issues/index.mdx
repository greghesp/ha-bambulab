## Issues

### Diagnostic File

If you run into any issues, we now have built in diagnostics.
To grab the latest information, hit the "Force Refresh Data" button under the Diagnostic section.

Then on the device info page for the printer entity, you will see a "Download Diagnostics" button.
Make sure you upload this to your Bug ticket/GitHub issue.

### Debug Logging

When logging a bug, always ensure you send us the debug logs. 

If you are hitting issues during initial integration setup, you will need to enable logs in your configuration.yaml file by adding the following and restarting Home Assistant:
```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.bambu_lab: debug
```

If you have previously successfully installed the integration, debug logs can be enabled from the integration page within Home Assistant:

The debug logs will appear in the standard Home Assistant logs.
