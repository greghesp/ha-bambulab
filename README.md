# Bambu Lab

A Home Assistant Integration for Bambu Lab printers.

## Contribution

Want to contribute to ha-bambulab? Great! We have a few small asks though!

- Please create your patch PRs against the `main` branch.
- Please name your commits accordingly, and add some context as to what you have added.

NOTE - we did previously use a separate `develop` branch for staging initial checkins. This is being retired.

If you feel this integration was valuable and want to support it in other ways, you can [buy me a coffee](https://Ko-fi.com/adriangarside).

## Setup

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=greghesp&repository=ha-bambulab&category=Integration)

To install this integration, add this GitHub Repo to the HACS Custom Repositories, or click the badge above.

For configuration, you'll ideally use your Bambu Credentials for the simplest setup and the most features as some sensors are supported by data from your Bambu cloud account print history. You can also, optionally, provide the printer's local IP address to enable the more efficient and reliable direct to printer connection for the printer sensor data and to enable the P1/A1 chamber image support.

However, the Bambu cloud connection doesn't support 2FA and passwordless social media accounts at this time. And it obviously does not support printers explicitly set to Lan Only Mode. If you fall into any of these categories, select the Lan Mode Configuration connection option. You will need to manually provide:

- Printer Serial Number - can be found in the printer settings or in Bambu Studio.
- Local printer IP address - can be found in the printer network settings (LAN).
- Access Code - can be found in the Printer settings.

### Setup using Bambu Cloud w/ OAuth

If you signed up using any OAuth method, you need to set a password for your Bambu Cloud account:

- Login to the Bambu mobile app using OAuth.
- Tap the person icon at the bottom right.
- Tap Account Security > Change Password.

This will allow you to set a password. Now you can login to the HA integration using your Bambu username and password
instead of OAuth.

| Sensor            | Notes                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Current Layer     |                                                 |
| Total Layer Count |                                                 |
| Print Progress    |                                                 |
| Print Weight      | With Bambu credentials                          |
| Print Length      | With Bambu credentials                          |
| Print Bed Type    | Bed choice in the print job                     |
| Start Time        | Simulated. More accurate with Bambu credentials |
| Remaining Time    |                                                 |
| End Time          |                                                 |
| Current Stage     |                                                 |
| Print Status      |                                                 |
| Cover Image       | With Bambu credentials                          |
| Total Usage Hours | \* See Note                                     |

\* This is a running estimate that will be imprecise. Starting hours can be read of the printer screen and provided during initial printer setup or updated later via the configuration flow. And the integration must be running when a print completes to update the value. For non-X1 printers, if the integration is restarted mid-print and Bambu cloud connection isn't setup, the usage hours will not be added as print start time won't be known. It's expected that you'll need to adjust this value occasionally to fix drift from the value the printer itself calculates.

### Automation device triggers

This integration implements a handful of device triggers to make some common automation scenarios a little easier.
See [device triggers](docs/DeviceTrigger.md).

## Example dashboard

You can find an amazing web configurator to easily create a Dashboard for your Bambu printer like the one below
at https://www.wolfwithsword.com/bambulab-home-assistant-dashboard/.

## Issues

### Diagnostic File

If you run into any issues, we now have built in diagnostics.
To grab the latest information, hit the "Force Refresh Data" button under the Diagnostic section.

![image](docs/images/force-refresh.png)

Then on the device info page for the printer entity, you will see a "Download Diagnostics" button.
Make sure you upload this to your Bug ticket/GitHub issue.

### Debug Logging

When logging a bug, always ensure you send us the debug logs. 

If you are hitting issues during initial integration setup, you will need to enable logs in your configuration.yaml file by adding the following and restarting Home Assistant:
```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.bambu_lab: debug
```

If you have previously successfully installed the integration, debug logs can be enabled from the integration page within Home Assistant:

![img.png](docs/images/debugging.png)

The debug logs will appear in the standard Home Assistant logs.
